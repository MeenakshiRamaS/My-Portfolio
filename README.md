## Project Description

Hello! I'm Meena and this is a personal portfolio. This website is designed to showcase my interests and experiences!

## Tech Stack

This website has been made with React {"{"} React Router, Slider, Scroll Motion {"}"}, JSX, Tailwind CSS, Vercel, Node.js, and npm package manager.

## App Features

This app features an About Me section, Experiences section, Projects section, and an additional other information section.
Several sections incorporate sliders for images and links via boxicons.

## Design Process with Figma

Links to the complete Figma wireframes are provided below:

[Figma Design] (https://www.figma.com/design/bb4NqZWSce7TZWYmDEPmM4/Portfolio_Website?node-id=0-1&m=dev&t=81ZmIhyd1NFm3LE8-1)

After the wireframes were complete I broke down the required components, objects, variables, and react frameworks needed. Once the main Components were complete, I followed my wireframes to add aesthetics and Tailwind CSS to ensure a clean and smooth user interface.

## Future Steps

This website is currenlty hosted on Vercel. I intend to use a custom domain name in the future!
